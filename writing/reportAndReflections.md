Question 7.http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.1520_46?lang=en

Here is the data of Total tetanus that I found from world health organization website. It indicates that the number of total tetanus case is decreased from 1980 to 2017 by Vaccine. It was 114251 cases at 1980 and it decreases to 12476 at 2017. Since I found these data from WHO which is a authoritative website,I am convinced by this data.



Question 8.

The system of public medicine is damaged by this article since combined vaccine lost its reputation. People choose to split combined vaccine to three separate shots. That also increase the fee of taking vaccine. Because Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997 a measles vaccine, if combined vaccine is canceled by this wrong article, Dr. Wakefield can make profits from that.

In this case, people should make sure there is no profit relationship between the potential research results and academic research groups. Therefore, the academic research groups can do research in a justice way.

It is not enough to fix the damage if the researcher just retracted his paper. The researcher need publish a new paper to correct his mistake that may help to fix the damage that he made.


Question 9.

It is really hard to say if vaccines are beneficial. Since after I research from WHO some of the `Vaccine-preventable communicable diseases` can be controlled such as the total tetanus that I discuss in question 7. However, there is another disease call yellow fever which is also a Vaccine-preventable communicable disease, but it was controlled well by vaccine.

http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.1520_50?lang=en

The number of people who have yellow fever is increasing from 2009 to 2011 and it reach the peak at 2011 (2591 people have yellow fever). After it was controlled, it increases again and reach the peak at 2016 (1154 people have yellow fever). These data indicates that yellow fever cannot be controlled well by vaccines

Therefore, vaccines may have benefit but it may not work efficiently all the time.


Question 10.

From last Friday talk, one thing impress me a lot. That is the difference of using data between writing nature science article and social science article. Since one of the speaker is nature scientist and another is scientist, although they are researching in a same area, they are using different way to analyze data. Because my major is Economics and my minor is Computer science, from that talk, I learn the difference of doing research in these two departments.
